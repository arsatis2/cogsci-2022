The bar graphs shows participants' belief inferences for:

* the hypothesis that the agent believed that pushing the blue box would turn on the bulb (blue bar).
* the hypothesis that the agent believed that pushing the orange box would turn on the bulb (orange bar).
* the hypothesis that the agent believed that pushing both boxes would turn on the bulb (green bar).

# Hypothesis Testing


## Belief Inferences

On belief inference, participants in the emotion condition were more likely to infer that the agent expected the blue box to turn on the bulb ($W = 3055.5, p < .001$) than participants in the no-emotion condition. This is consistent with our interpretation that participants in the emotion condition inferred that the agent expected that pushing the blue box would turn on the bulb, hence leading to his initial failed action.
```{r testing-hypotheses-on-expectation-blue}

wilcox.test(expBlueNorm ~ condition, ecl_dat)
```

Participants in the emotion condition were less likely to infer that the agent expected both boxes to turn on the bulb ($W = 1028.5, p < 0.001$) than participants in the no-emotion condition. Again, this is consistent with the interpretation that the participants inferred the agent's intention to push box boxes from the beginning. 

```{r testing-hypotheses-on-expectation-both}

wilcox.test(expBothNorm ~ condition, ecl_dat)
```


## Causal Inferences

As expected, participants in the emotion condition were more likely to infer that the orange box turned on the bulb ($W = 2924, p < .001$), than participants in the no-emotion condition. We explained that participants in the emotion condition saw the agent's first action (pushing blue box) as a mistake and hence, gave higher likelihood to the other box (orange box).
```{r testing-hypotheses-on-causal-structure-orange}

wilcox.test(relationOrangeNorm  ~ condition, ecl_dat)
```

Also, participants in the emotion condition were less likely to infer that pushing both boxes turned on the bulb ($W = 1507.0, p = .008$), than participants in the no-emotion condition. We explained that participants in the no-emotion condition assumed that both of the agent's actions were intended and hence, inferred through the agent's knowledge that both boxes were causally important to turn on the bulb. It should be noted that this hypothesis was still the modal hypothesis for participants across both conditions, despite their relative differences.

```{r testing-hypotheses-on-causal-structure-both}

wilcox.test(relationOrangeBlueNorm  ~ condition, ecl_dat)
```



## Desire Inferences

With regards to desire inference, participants in the emotion condition were more likely to infer that the agent desired to turn on the light bulb ($W = 2527.5, p = .01$). However, from the descriptive means, we can see that participants in both conditions inferred strongly that the agent likely desired to turn on the bulb.
```{r testing-desire-inferences}
wilcox.test(desire ~ condition, ecl_dat)
```

This table describes the mean (and SD in brackets) of the scaled desire ratings (between 0 and 1) for the emotion and no-emotion conditions.
```{r descriptives-for-desire-inferences}
ecl_dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(
    desire = paste0(round(mean(desire, na.rm = T),2)," (",round(sd(desire, na.rm = T),2), ")")
  )
```


## Knowledge Inferences

Finally, with regards to knowledge inference, participants in the emotion condition were less likely to infer that the agent was knowledgeable about how to turn on the bulb ($W= 1049.5, p < .001$) than participants in the no-emotion condition. This makes sense as the agent in the emotion condition signaled that he failed his initial action (pushing the blue box).
```{r testing-knowledge-inferences}
wilcox.test(knowledge ~ condition, ecl_dat)
```
This table describes the mean (and SD in brackets) of the scaled knowledge ratings (between 0 and 1) for the emotion and no-emotion conditions.
```{r descriptives-for-knowledge-inferences}
ecl_dat %>%
  group_by(condition) %>%
  summarise(
    knowledge = paste0(round(mean(knowledge, na.rm = T),2)," (",round(sd(knowledge, na.rm = T),2), ")")
  )
```
